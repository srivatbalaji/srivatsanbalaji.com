# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a personal website for Srivatsan Balaji built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The site features an interactive homepage with draggable buttons and a minimalist aesthetic inspired by Tom Sachs, Ai Weiwei, and manual building aesthetics.

## Architecture

The website uses a simple multi-page structure:
- **index.html**: Interactive homepage with draggable buttons generated by JavaScript
- **about.html, projects.html, experience.html, contact.html**: Static content pages
- **script.js**: Core interactivity - draggable button system with collision detection
- **styles.css**: CSS styling using Inter font with sidebar navigation layout
- **images/**: Button icons and visual assets

## Key Components

### JavaScript Architecture (script.js)
- Draggable system with mouse event handling and collision detection
- Button configuration array defining interactive elements with images, links, and positioning
- Dynamic button generation with overlap prevention
- Text hiding during drag operations for smooth UX

### CSS Structure (styles.css)
- Sidebar navigation (200px fixed width) on the left
- Main content area offset by sidebar width
- Inter font family with clean, minimal styling
- Responsive button positioning and hover effects

## Development Commands

This is a static website with no build process. To develop:
- Open HTML files directly in browser or use a local server
- Edit HTML/CSS/JS files directly - changes are immediately visible

## File Structure Notes

- All HTML pages share the same navigation structure
- Button images are stored in `/images/` directory
- The site uses a CNAME file for custom domain deployment
- No package manager or build tools are used - pure vanilla web technologies
